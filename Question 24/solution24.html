My Solution was derived from this webpage (See Combinatorics)
http://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-24-millionth-lexicographic-permutation/

"First we want to figure out, which number is first in the millionth lexicographical permutation. 
The last nine digits can be ordered in 9! = 362880 ways. So the first 362880 permutations start with a 0. 
The permutations from 362881 to 725760 start with a 1 and then the permutations from 725761 to 1088640 starts with a 2. 
Based on that it is clear that the millionth permutation is in the third interval, and thus must start with a 2. etc "
